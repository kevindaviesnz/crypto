Swap Fee Order (Lowest to Highest)

	1.	Monero (XMR):
	•	Monero generally has the lowest transaction fees among these options due to its privacy features and lighter network. The fees for swapping Monero on Cake Wallet will be lower compared to most other coins.
	2.	Nano (NANO):
	•	Nano is a feeless cryptocurrency, meaning there are no transaction fees on the network. Swapping Nano should be close to zero fees besides any ShapeShift fee.
	3.	Tron (TRX):
	•	Tron has very low network fees. Transaction fees are typically in the $0.01 to $0.10 range, making it one of the cheaper options for swapping.
	4.	Solana (SOL):
	•	Solana’s fees are extremely low, typically under $0.01 per transaction. This makes Solana an attractive option for low-fee swaps.
	5.	Polygon (MATIC):
